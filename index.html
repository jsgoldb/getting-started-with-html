    <h1> What is the web?</h1>
<p>The "web" is a collection of
  documents written in Hypertext Markup 
  Language, or <b>HTML</b>. These documents
  are interpreted and displayed by browsers.<br><br>
  To find a file, a browser makes a request via the internet to a <em>server</em>, 
  using a <em>hypertext transfer protocol</em>, or <b>HTTP</b>.<br><br>
</p>
It's important to remember that <em>
  computers are stupid
</em>, so programmers have to be extremely
careful to use correct syntax at all times
<h2>More about HTML</h2>
<p>HTML is made of: <br>
  -text content (what you see) <br>
  -<b>markup</b> (how the content is arranged) <br>
  -references to other documents <br>
  -links to other pages 
</p>

<p>HTML consists of <b>elements</b>, made up of <b>tags.</b> <br>
Most elements have a opening tag and a closing tag, with <br>
the contents in between, unless it is a <em>void</em>
tag, which contains<br> no elements. Each tag in turn can have <em>attributes</em>, which are <br>
always assigned a value.</p>

<em>Inline</em> elements work in-line, like the br, or break, tag. <br>
<em>Block</em> elements, like the p, or paragraph, tag, create an "invisible" box around the contents, which have dimension.
